# simanneal
Created by Jim Jenkins, 2016

This project was for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class in Fall 2016 semester at University of Colorado Boulder. It attempts to provide a solution to the gerrymandering problem in the United States by implementing the simulated annealing algorithm in Python.

The code is set up to use the provided "Large State" sample data which is a grid of fake households which are then fairly divided by the algorithm to create a balanced, competitive district layout. You may also enter sample data via the command line if you prefer.
